 * SETTINGS
 * This layer should only house settings that need to be accessed from anywhere, including Sass variables.
 * Examples of global settings might be things like the base font size, color palettes, and so on.

 * TOOLS
 * This layer should include global mixins and functions.

/*
 * Section C
 * GENERIC
 * The Generic layer is the first one that actually produces any CSS.
 * It houses very high-level, far reaching styles.
 * This layer is seldom modified, and is usually the same across any projects you work on.
 * It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules, CSS resets and so on.
 *
 * Reset.css un-styles every element.
 * Normalize.css styles browsers to render elements more consistently with each other.
 * Sanitize.css styles browsers to render elements more consistently with developer expectations and preferences.
 *
 * NOTE: You probably only need one of the following...

 * ELEMENTS
 * These are bare, unclassed HTML elements.
 * It is very rarely added to or changed after initial setup.
 * Once we have defined element-level styles, all additions and deviations should be implemented using classes.

 * Section F
 * COMPONENTS
 * The Components layer is where we begin to style recognizable pieces of UI.
 * We shouldn't find any selectors with a lower specificity than one class in this layer.
 * This is where the majority of your work will happen after initial project set-up.
 * Adding new components and features usually makes up the vast majority of development.
